# chd_ui
Windows UI for CHD converter

Requirements to run the script
Python 3

Make sure you have Python version 3.x installed.

You can download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Tkinter module (usually included with standard Python installations)

Used for the GUI interface.

On some Linux distros, you may need to install it separately, for example:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
chdman tool

This is the command-line tool your GUI calls to convert/extract CHD files.

You must have chdman installed and accessible from your systemâ€™s PATH environment variable so the script can call it.


Operating System

Compatible with Windows,(if chdman and Python/Tkinter are set up).
